                    I study EE because I wanted to work closer to the machine. 
                    Most of my courses are in the embedded systems concentration. 
                    We do a lot of work in Verilog, C, and some MATLAB.

                    Connect FPGA is a Connect 4 game on FPGA. I worked on developing 
                    and testing the UART communication modules to enable multi-player 
                    with two FPGAs (not pictured). I also did the hardware design 
                    and implementation for handling player input.

                <h3>T-Mobile</h3>
                <p>
                    For the past year, I have interned at T-Mobile on the 
                    Corporate Information Security team and Technology Foundation team. 
                    My work includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Administrative management tool for cloud instances</li>
                    <li>Custom JavaScript agile dashboards</li>
                    <li>Educational resources for git rebase, squash, and cherry-pick</li>
                    <li>Git hooks to support new development practices</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                <p>
                    For two years, I served on the executive cabinet of Chi Sigma 
                    Alpha, an Asian-interest sorority under United Greek Council. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were established at UW Seattle in 2002. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my leadership, I mitigated and resolved conflicts 
                    unique to multicultural greek life. I had to make decisions 
                    around standardizing new member education, developing new fair 
                    rules and fines that reflect and adapt to our needs, 
                    solving interpersonal conflicts without bias, 
                    and keeping positive greek community relations. As a result, our 
                    house has doubled over from 13 to 45 sisters!
