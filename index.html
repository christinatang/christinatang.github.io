                <p>
                    My undergraduate goal was to educate myself at the intersection of computer science 
                    and electrical engineering. I concentrated in embedded systems, and I have experience 
                    from circuits to machine learning.

                    <strong>Connect FPGA</strong> is a Connect 4 game on FPGA. I worked on developing 
                    and testing the UART communication modules to enable multi-player 
                    with two FPGAs (not pictured). I also did the hardware design 
                    and implementation that handles player input.

                <h3>T-Mobile, 2017 - 2019</h3>
                <p>
                    I interned at T-Mobile on the 
                    Corporate Information Security team and Technology Foundation team. 
                    Here are some things I worked on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Building the front-end for an administrative web app</li>
                    <li>Custom JavaScript dashboards for agile teams</li>
                    <li>Technical documents for git rebase, squash, and cherry-pick</li>
                    <li>Git hooks to support new development repository</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Community</h2>
                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                <p>
                    For two years, I served on the executive cabinet of Chi Sigma 
                    Alpha, an Asian-interest sorority under United Greek Council. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my leadership, I mitigated and resolved conflicts 
                    unique to multicultural greek life. I had to make decisions 
                    around standardizing new member education, developing new fair 
                    rules that reflect and adapt to our needs, 
                    solving interpersonal conflicts without bias, 
                    and keeping positive greek community relations.
