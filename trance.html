							<h2>The Impact of Commercialization: A Look at Trance</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
						<h2>About the essay</h2>
						One of my greatest passions in life is trance and electronic dance music. I am interested in these topics in many ways, including history, sound, live experience, progression, and culture. While I was taking college in high school, I had the opportunity to choose my topic for the required expository essay. <br><br>
						<h2>Update 9/5/15:</h2><p> My essay is not updated with current trends. Trance and EDM are both changing rapidly, and there are more examples that could be added. However, I wanted to preserve my writing as a high school work, so I may write more at a later time.</p>

						<h1>The Impact of Commercialization: <br>A Look at Trance [2015]</h1>
						by Christina Tang
						<br><br>
						When people seek to become more individualized, they tend to stray away from the mainstream world. Popular songs and movies are the same entertainment appealing to the same masses over and over again. However, all trends change over time and the mainstream sphere is just too difficult to draw lines around. How popular does an actress need to be before he or she can be considered a superstar? It&rsquo;s not just celebrities; culture movements are difficult to define either. For example, one decade it&rsquo;s funky disco and the next decade is about hip hop soul. What happens when a culture ceases to be trend? There is no concrete, empirical way to decide what is in the mainstream. Unfortunately, popularity is never an indication of quality assurance. Fame is not inherently bad, but fame has an evil little sister, commercialization, an ultimate suppressor of creativity often overlooked. For example, millions of electronic music fans globally enjoy electronic music, but not enough have thought about what the billion dollar industry has done to the music. Trance is a musical genre with loyal fans that have been arguing about sellout artists and genre labeling ever since its debut, but recent changes in mainstream electronic music have commercialized trance culture for the worst. 
						<br><br>           

						In the early 1990s, trance derived from its parent Hi-NRG, a style of disco with less funk and more spitting synths at a higher tempo than typical disco. Trance has always been a danceable genre and because of these disco roots, trance was able to spread to raves, or long electronic music dance parties, all over the world. In the 90s, when electronic music was making its general debut with house, trance, techno, and breakbeat, many producers looked forward to make something unique in the new realm of music that technology had unlocked. Subgenres like industrial techno, speed garage, and dream trance all strived and died from experimentation and the changing tastes of dancing consumers. But like Hi-NRG, did the subgenres really die as they got cast away from popularity? Or do they live on through their evolved successors? Although musical elements live on through time, the change in culture and mentality cannot be denied.             
						<br><br>
						The history of trance music is intriguing because it has been lively enough to enter the mainstream music sphere not once, but twice, all in the span of less than 20 years. 1999 is often referred to as the &quot;Golden Year&quot; for trance. However, because techno was the popular term for electronic music at the time, not everyone realizes the amount of trance they may have listened to. Darude&rsquo;s &quot;Sandstorm,&quot; which earned gold certification in Sweden, Germany, and the United States, is a good example of what was improperly labeled techno. When people think about trance music, DJ Tisteo is the most popular memory. He was the DJ for the entire opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece, which resulted in a mix titled Parade of the Athletes. Trance music has also made its way into popular movies such as Mean Girls (2004), Hackers (1995), and Mortal Kombat (1995). This timeframe from 1999 to 2004 was known as trance&rsquo;s peak commercialization.            
						<br><br>
						Understanding why trance peaked for the second time requires knowledge of electronic dance music, or EDM as it was coined in late 2000s. Electronic music has always been hand-in-hand with parties, but it has never been as apparent and legal as musical festivals held in the 2000s. At first, it was just the pure electronic music festivals, but now, festivals like counterculture Lighting in a Bottle and alternative rock Sasquatch will invite a few EDM producers. EDM officially entered every household when Skrillex, an experimental electronic producer, added musical &quot;drops&quot; consisting of bass wubs and wobbles to dubstep and changed what would become popular EDM. 
						<br><br>
						As people created dubstep remixes of Harry Potter and Super Mario themes, dubstep was the first time the mainstream sphere had sought out electronic music. Event promoters like SoCal’s Insomniac Events and Seattle’s United States of Consciousness (USC) brought these newly famous producers to their events, attracting more partygoers than ever before, introducing the general public to electronic music. Insomniac’s most famous festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, has reached the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. More and more young adults are seeking out festivals all over the world. Belgium’s Tomorrowland, the largest electronic music festival in the world, sold out just one second in 2013. In just a few years, festivals are now the new era of raving, with elements never seen before: masses in the 100,000s, superstar DJs, and energetic musical &quot;drops.&quot; EDM has grown into the trend of today, so when a teenager reaches 18, they no longer go clubbing; they go to the new era of raves.           
						<br><br>
						From dubstep to house and trance, the drop was now essential for every producer if they wanted success. People have already heard dubstep from its earlier place in mainstream culture, so any EDM that resembled the bass drops became popular. Nobody had time to listen to DJ Tiesto&rsquo;s famous cover of &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; by classical composer Charles Barber. It was 9 minutes long and didn&rsquo;t have a bass drop to captivate the new mass of party fans.  Numerous producers have marginalized original style in order to appeal to the electronic music festival-goers and promoters. For example, Tiesto dropped the &quot;DJ&quot; when he announced his leave from Black Hole Recordings in 2009 to make the EDM that partygoers craved. Most of EDM is now a form of house music. Although dubstep is now less prominent in EDM, Skrillex&rsquo;s bass drop experimentation has influenced beyond dubstep. People put their hands in the air during the build up and jumped up and down when the drop happened; so much for dance music. Of course, straying away from originality put many fans in anger, but in defense of the new superstars, people argue that producers have the free reign to change style.
						<br><br>
						Trance producers other than Tiesto needed to make their change more discreet in order to please both old trance fans and new EDM fans, so the love child &quot;trance 2.0&quot; subgenre was born, influenced by electro house, complete with the drop.  Above & Beyond dropped their radio show Trance Around the World for Group Therapy, essentially terminating their contract with trance. Armin van Buuren is sometimes referred to as today&rsquo;s Tiesto, and his successful radio show A State of Trance, started in 2001, celebrates every 50 episodes with parties in countries all over the world from Argentina to Kazakhstan. Buuren&rsquo;s radio show has 20 million listeners spread over 50 countries, but after the 550th episode, each ASOT episode began with trance 2.0. Thankfully, Armin remains true to his roots and balances old trance and new EDM, but the strongest fighter is UK-based Rich Solarstone and his Pure Trance movement. Over the next few years, more and more trance producers left trance for electro house, leaving the trance community in anger. Trance fans have obtained a poor reputation by quickly harassing producers and their coincidental style change. What fandom wouldn&rsquo;t be mad when the leading figures leave to make more money elsewhere? However, trance 2.0 was not the first time trance encountered a musical split with angered fans. During the first peak of trance, fans like the writer of Ishkur&rsquo;s Guide to Electronic Music, have expressed opposition against the directions trance was going. Dream trance, anthem trance, and Dutch trance were criticized for being too poppy or having too-long breakdowns. Ironically, Dutch trance still exists, and although the long breakdowns were previously disliked by early trance purists, they are a favorite of many trance listeners today.
						<br><br>
						Commercialization has not only buried the original emotional intention of trance, but for house music, the term progressive house has now been tainted by the influx of commercialized house music being labeled progressive house. The voice from the true fans of trance, progressive house, and other genres are now smothered to silence. It is important to acknowledge why genres are important to these music fans because they are the ones that truly appreciate the music and love it enough to describe, organize, and write about it, as if to keep it from dying.
						<br><br>
						People have thought trance music got its name from appealing to emotions, inducing euphoria and highs. Now the idea sticks around, despite the change in musical structure and shallow use in mainstream partying. People also thought that raves were just drug parties, but this idea also stuck around and lures new era ravers into believing that the drugs are essential to the music. Unfortunately, this led to irresponsible drug use at EDM festivals and also angered the drug community for putting drugs negatively in the media. In 2013, Hawaii’s main promoter lost its privilege to host events at the Kaka ako Waterfront after too many drug-related hospitalizations, and New York&rsquo;s Electric Zoo day 3 was cancelled after two drug-related deaths. This is an easy example of commercialization gone sour.
						<br><br>
						Commercialized EDM has caused lots of problems for trance fans. Many fans were quick to scream &quot;traitor!&quot; for every non-trance track that came out from any producer that has ever made trance. Comments like &quot;old trance is better&quot; and &quot;trance is dying&quot; litter the comments in articles, videos, and Facebook statuses, which gives trance fans a bad reputation. The truth is, trance has never started dying and will never die because there are numerous producers, new and old, that are still producing the trance sound that purists love. Much of the trance community needs to accept that many producers have left the scene, instead of redefining the genre to include them. Problems arose when fans cared more about the producers than the music, because the producers became superstars no matter what music they made and people attended festivals for the party rather than the music.
						<br><br>
						Like all else than enters the mainstream, trance 2.0 and the rest of commercialized EDM will pass. Trance music has changed musically, but most importantly, it has changed culturally. However, the most passionate trance fans will never let trance be musically redefined to include what commercialization caused. Perhaps in the future, when the focus shifts back to music, integrity may return to the producers and fans. Right now, trance and EDM are stuck in the mainstream sphere, but nothing will stop the winds of mainstream entertainment from redrawing its borders once again.
